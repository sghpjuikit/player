This update continues improving UX by fixing issues and preventing user to get into unintuitive UI situations.

Windows UX have been improved. Popups respect onTop and focus of their parents and gain/lose top z-order properly.
Transparent windows now support click-through behavior and remain interactive. For better UX, click-through is off when window is focused.
This allows using non-interactive always-on-top widgets for HUDs and overlays.
There is still work to be done regarding cumbersome control of transparent windows with no content, window resizing and so on.

The **Spektrum** widget has been massively improved.
It now supports large number of separate settings that can be freely combined into unique effects.
For instance, the widget allows specifying various data as input (FFT, volume, etc), various data transformations, drawing styles and
multiple effects, such as pulsing, mirroring, shifting and more. These are all applied separately and more choices could easily be implemented.
The widget could still do with some drawing optimizations and also suffers absolute vs relative coordinate/sizing issue that I am not sure how to tackle at the moment.

The **Comet** widget has been brought up to date.
Several issues have been fixed, mainly small game graphics, which is scaled up 2x.
Performance has been improved to cause no issues even in 4k, by rendering the Canvas at smaller size. This does introduce slight blurring for Canvas elements.
There are still number of issue, such as experimental features and performance issues regarding number of objects potentially crashing the game.
The widget may become bundled with the application in the future.

The **Converter** widget have long suffered from two issues.
First, initial state was set to Unit with transformation chain of containing `As Is` function.
The initial chain is now empty and pasting any content changes the input, rather than appends it to transformation chain.
Second, the functor picker, using ComboBox, did not make it easy to find sought after functor.
The selector is now a TextField with an autocomplete, which allows smartly to select the functor based on name and type.

For this both the chain and autocompletion components needed some improvements.
Particularly the autocomplete. It now handles events properly so to allow controlling the suggestions list and text field at once.
This solution is a satisfactory replacement for the non-existent ComboBox with search, which proved too problematic to realize.

This update brings lots of pleasant improvements. Particularly styling.

First, finally, **JDK** has been updated. It took 3 years to get over **JDK12**. Time flies.
The `linkJDK` Gradle task has been removed from build dependencies and now requires manual run. It is more of a convenience anyway.
Now, **JDK** updates are very comfortable. By the way, the project still uses **OpenJ9**, now called Semeru.

The application process command has received a no-op argument to help to distinguish the process from other Java processes.
This would not be such an issue if the **Launch4j** was set up to wrap the .jar into .exe, but it currently does not work well for 64-bit version.
This requires more research and testing to implement right, so for now, at least the command was enhanced.

The widgets **Icon browser**, **Git projects** and **Tester** now use much improved and unified UI for selecting content.
Focusing, hovering, selecting from the list of content choices using both mouse and keys is supported and works very nicely.

There are two new skins: **White Leaf** and **Dark Leaf**.
These are light and dark green themes easy on the eyes and with good contrast.

There are two new widgets: **Song Info (small)** and **Album Info (small)**.
These display basic song and song album information. The former is an improved version of the default **Now Playing** notification content.
This change is following the trend of many small widgets instead of few complicated ones. This gives more power to the user.

New names and icons for some widgets make them easier to find and use.
Even better, all the registered `Node` classes, viable to be used as widgets are now available as separate widgets.
This was surprisingly trivial to implement, and it truly improves the UX.
In the future, there may be widget metadata support for these widgets, such as icons or descriptions. There is potential for a lots of improvements here.

Another new feature is a graphical playlist table column for a pause/resume icon.
The icon allows controlling the playback from the **Playlist** widget - definitely useful.
In the future, there will probably be more such columns and with automatic width resizing and styling support.

Application's tables and other table-like components have also become more usable and elegant.
The ui elements relying on `Canvas` now support skin colors.

The **Function Viewer** widget has full `BigDecimal` support now.
This was not easy, different library for expression evaluation was necessary and using `BigDecimal`s properly is difficult.
There were lots of arithmetic errors related to precision, resulting in incorrect values, bad performance, exceptions and even infinite loops.
These are all solved and the plotter not supports unlimited zooming and precision.
The graph also highlights area under the function, which is elegant and quite helpful.

The **Spektrum** widget has also become prettier, as it uses more sophisticated and configurable smoothing.
These changes have been applied from the original project the widget is based on.

- Fix drag & drop when external application sets `FILES` to empty list
- Fix **Logger** widget `area.wrapText` observability and default value not applied correctly
- Fix **cmd** file lookup not finding certain files sometimes

This update brings lots of usability improvements.

The main improvement is layout I/O UI.
The I/O ui was originally tied to **Switch** container, which provides the ui move/zoom capability, which affects the **IO**.
Because of this, layouts, which do not use **Switch** container (docks and overlays) did not support input/output editing.
The I/O layer has been made to support both **Layout** and **Switch** (which effectively acts as top level).
So there is no need to figure out which of the two needs to have it and no extra containers just for I/O.
When **Layout** contains **Switch**, it lets **Switch** take care of I/O. Now every content supports I/O, including docs and overlays.

Another improvement is content inspection/processing using **ActionPane**.
First, there is automatic content detection after **CTRL+V** or **drag & drop**.
Second, just like `Collection`s are displayed in table, `String`s are now displayed in `TextArea`, which can now change its wrapText settings through context menu.
This will be further improved to support images, or displaying text representation of objects that have no natural representation.
Ideally, this functionality would be absorbed into **Object Info** widget.

Another improvement is bgr task management.
First, task invoked through forms/popups now also display in task list. This makes closing the window not a destructive operation (as progress could no longer be tracked).
Second, if the task ends with error, this error can be displayed by clicking on the task result warn icon in the task list, which opens **ActionPane**. This makes it possible to track task errors.
Third, tasks that do parallel processing or produce multiple outputs (potentially with errors) also return future, can be tracked and have their errors displayed.
Actually acting on the errors is still not very easy.
The table should get `Try.Ok/Error` filtering predicates, nested columns (for `Ok` and `Success` branch) and transformation capabilities (like **Converter** widget).
These may come in future updates.

This update refactors the code to further unify actions for `ActionPane` and actions for `ContextMenu`.
Introduced is `ActContext`- an invocation context carrying auxiliary data, such as source of the event.
This enables using actions outside `ActionPane`, even if they use it. Now any action can be used in context menu.

Regarding the application shutdown fix - the old solution was brought back to forcefully shut down JVM even if non-daemon threads are running.
This is because proper cleanup is never guaranteed even if `App` is already stopped.

I took a little break from coding, but I am back. This version brings major improvements, so I am bumping up to **3.0.0**.

First, the project is now finally using **Kotlin**/**Java** toolchain, which automates **JDK** setup into a build.
Yes, it means the build does not require any JDK installed!
So developers can now simply clone the repository and build/run through **Gradle** with no extra steps, without leaving **CLI**.
The build is much simplified, as most of the Java checking/setup has been removed.
Previously, migrating **Java** was a headache, but not anymore. I plan to use **Java 17**, a much-needed upgrade from **12**.

As for the application, several areas have received major upgrade.

Tables are the heart of the library as well as pride of this player.
This version finally fixes slow selecting, which could in large tables take up to several minutes!

Table sorting has been identified to cause problems, such as taking up to several seconds in some scenarios!
After some refactor, the speedup has turned out to be huge, for **Song Table (Big)**, which is the view-everything table, the reduction for 50k songs was 2.5s -> 50ms.
50ms still blocks ui for 3 frames (on 60Hz display), enough to cause ui loading problems, particularly during animations.
UI loading in general is problematic, because the single-threaded nature of UI frameworks will not allow for optimization.
But, I managed to make sorting for all tables asynchronous. This was tricky because in some scenarios the application must not expect the items in correct order.
But now table performance does not degrade with item count. UI responsiveness when table is loading or sorting is now 60hz smooth!

I also simplified widget/container controls. There is fewer icons and much better menu.
The changes provided a noticeable performance gain while moving/zooming the UI, which is now 60Hz smooth as well.
In edit mode, the layout can be traversed by **RMB**/**LMB**, and now it includes **Switch** container, which, as top container, was not previously accessible.

**FreeForm** container, which provides windows-in-window, can be used in screen overlays or bottom-most screen overlays.
Therefore, proper functioning is absolutely integral. After more use/testing several problems have been identified.
With this update, it has become much easier to use thx to improved styling and drag&drop, which it relies on in lots of situations.
This component is complicated, and I will continue to improve it.

Besides these changes, many smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
Both the project and the application have never been in better state.

For the future, I have no exact plans yet. I will continue to go through the backlog - it contains lots of non-trivial ideas.
However, the priority will also be to keep improving UX.

## [2.1.0] 2021 09 26

- Improve widget i/o system
  - Avoid creating ui elements for i/o in other windows
    - Improves performance
    - Removes visual artefacts
  - Implement context menus for linking/unlinking widget i/o
  - Implement support for application-wide `Input` and `Output`
  - Implement **Song Library** and **Playing song** as `Output` instead of `InOutput`
  - Remove ui support for application-wide i/o
- Improve markdown styling
- Improve Json serialization for arrays, unsigned numbers and nullable types
- Improve String char16, char32, grapheme facilities
- Improve widget & plugin settings UX
  - Add context menu support for ComponentFactory & PluginBox
  - Simplify & improve layout
  - Improve interaction (remove obscure behavior, add hover effects)
- Improve component ui controls header icons  
  **Settings** and **Actions** icons were merged into **Menu icon**, which is more flexible as well as consistent with window headers.
  In the future, the menu may be customizable through `CoreMenus`.
- Improve code
- Fix several widget serialization/deserialization issues

## [2.0.0] 2021 09 19

- Implement smart window resize (`window drag + SHIFT + LMB`) - resize window to available screen area  
  This behavior may be tweaked in the future, and leveraged more extensively.
- Implement running programs through .lnk files
- Implement `Class` & `KClass` editor autocomplete  
  It is difficult to obtain loaded class list, so instead hardcoded list is provided by developer in form of a resource file.
  More entries may be added to the list in the future.
- Improve markdown styling and UX
- Improve code
- Fix wrong table group column name in some table column menus

## [2.0.0] 2021 09 10

- Much improved handling of song's `TAGS: Set<String>` tag. The field:
  - has better editor
  - is displayed and can be quick-edited through **FileInfo** widget
  - supports autocompletion
  - supports song table grouping
- improved song chapters support in **PlayerControlsCircle** widget's circular seeker
  - layout and sizing issues
  - chapter hover effect
  - chapter click shows chapter popup & edit
- more converting functions
- fixes related to styling `MenuBar`, song tagging (`wav`), threading issues, reflection, and more

The tags grouping was tricky, because it is a multivalued tag.
Now that multivalued tags are supported, artist tag could also become `List<String>`, which would fix long-standing issue of grouping by artist.
Adding song chapters through circular seeker is not yet done, because it is not clear what the UX should be like.

## [2.0.0] 2021 09 03

- improved **Node** widget with better context menu & class suggestions. Also renamed to **Custom**.
- Improved ComboBox styling & autocompletion UX
- Improved table sorting through context menu & add playlist table sorting by db columns. It is finally possible to sort playlist by rating
- Improve **Converter** widget layout and Action settings
- Improved TextArea context menu
- Improve markdown node (drag&drop, anchors, animations)
- Improve ContainerFreeForm (resizing, absolute sizes, position aligning)
- Simplify window header & introduce window context menus
- Unify App actions, App context menu, Tray context menu, Window context menu
- More minor tweaks

The new context menus are an important addition and solve the issue of feature discoverability. I wanted to avoid this for years, but there simply is no better (compact) way. Anyway, now I can add Help/Documentation/About pages

The markdown still needs more work with link resolving as well as file monitoring and automatic reload. [RichTextFX](https://github.com/FXMisc/RichTextFX) may be used to produce more optimized and powerful UI.

## [2.0.0] 2021 08 27

- Support for Markdown text was implemented.
  - **GameView** widget is now using this for game info
  - new **GitProjects** widget has been implemented to browse git projects. It simply lists git projects in a directory and shows the `README.md` files. More features may come later
- **Kotlin** `1.5.30`. In the future I'll use gradle jvm toolchain so JVM sets up automatically. This will alleviate the remaining pains when setting up the project.
- Added cool stuff to **Voronoi** visualisation widget

Finally, an app user documentation can be written, as markdown of course. This will take a while and probably result in improving UX all around.

What's next? Well, as is, the application is very polished and has a lot of powerful features. I'd consider this state more or less ready for making available to anyone out there.

1. Right now, I'd like to keep improving the window system to make it easier to set up desktop-level widgets.
   Improving the Node widget will be necessary as well as discovery of recommended ui components for Node widget.
   This also involves more FreeFormContainer features, such as absolute resizing, snapping and styling.
1. I also want to integrate context menus and object actions (icons in `ActionPane` overlay) more closely, so that these are merely a different UX for the same thing.
   This requires implicit action parameter handling in menu (probably by displaying a Form for each parameter) and more convenient navigation in `ActionPane` (back & forth, custom ui, etc.).
   This also several other technicalities, so it will be challenging to come up with pleasant solution.
   The actions will probably end up defined as custom objects (and registered in global pool) rather than ordinary functions, which is unfortunate, but maybe special delegated properties could help.
1. Better initial experience & application documentation would also be nice, for example there is still no **About page**.
   Window headers are also too cluttered, maybe ordinary menu bar would be a better idea. Window headers could be their own components as well.

## [2021 08 21]

- improved how windows & window headers auto-hide and improved styling. The reworked functionalities make the application much more pleasant to use.
- improved `GpuNvidiaInfo` UI, although it requires more work.

## [2021 08 19]

- improved documentation, provided commands to build executable application from source  
  I'm thinking this may actually be better than doing releases, will see.
- improved `Container`s. They now have settings and support padding. Free-form has several issues fixed, further improving its use in various use-cases.

- Application (?) icons with UX tooltips (use help/component help)
- Dependencies: javafx.web, javafx.fxml
- Annotation support for Config constraints, use delegated configurable properties and ConfigDefinition instead

## [v0.7.0]
### Added
- Initial release features
